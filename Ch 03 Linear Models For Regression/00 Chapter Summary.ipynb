    "<li> Linear models (LM) are linear functions of the parameters $W$, and yet can be nonlinear with respect to the input variables.\n",
    "<li> Many methods are nothing but a generalization to linear models, including NN and even classification methods.\n",
    "<li> Given $D = \\{(X_{1}, t_{1}),..,(X_{N}, t_{N})\\}$, predict the value of $t$ for a new value of $x$. This can be done by:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <p> <b>1)</b> Simple function $F(X)$ maps directly to $y$.\n",
    "        <p> <b>2)</b> Probablistic perspective, where we model $P(t|X)$, it expresses our uncertainity about t for each value of x,              in such a way that minimize the expected value of loss function.\n",

And this cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood function, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-fitting.\n",
