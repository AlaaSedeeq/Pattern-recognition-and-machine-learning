### I've started reading Christopher Bishop's fantastic book, <a class="class" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf" id="id">"Pattern recognition and machine learning"</a>
Every chapter I complete will be summarised here, along with some examples and exercises from the book and some algorithms implementations.
